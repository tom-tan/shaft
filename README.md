Shaft is a workflow engine for the [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) (CWL).
It aims to be an internal component of other full featured workflow engines such as [ep3](https://github.com/tom-tan/ep3). Therefore it only supports [CommandLineTool](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/CommandLineTool.html) and [ExpressionTool](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/Workflow.html#ExpressionTool) definitions in local machines.
